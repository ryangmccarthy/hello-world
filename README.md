Learning
I am turning 26 years old, and I am learning to code for the 1st time. I have a wonderful girlfriend named Wora that I am moving in with in Austin, TX at the end of the year. I am taking this coding class to learn a little more about coding, so I get have a a more comprehensive understanding of what's going on when I'm talking to a programmer or software developer.
